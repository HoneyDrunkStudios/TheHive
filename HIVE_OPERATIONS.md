# 🧠 HIVE OPERATIONS MANIFEST  
**The Hive — Central Intelligence of HoneyDrunk Studios**

> “Every Node is alive. Every Signal matters.”

---

## ⚙️ PURPOSE
The Hive is the control grid that connects all operational Nodes across HoneyDrunk Studios.  
It exists to maintain order, document architecture, and track integration status for every system — from SDKs to SaaS, from creative tools to backend services.

---

## 🧩 HIERARCHY OVERVIEW

| Layer | Description | Example |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| **The Hive** | Org-level neural control grid | This repo + GitHub Project |
| **Nodes** | Individual repos, packages, or apps | Vault, Pulse, Forge, Tether |
| **Grid** | Infrastructure layer (pipelines, deployment, monitoring) | Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions |
| **Signals** | Communications, updates, or data pings between systems | Logs, Telemetry, Notifications |
| **Edgerunners** | Human or AI operators maintaining Hive alignment | Oleg, Copilot, GPT-5 |

---

## 🧭 OPERATIONAL FLOW

| Phase | Trigger | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| **🟡 In Planning** | New idea or Node proposal | Captured as draft issue in The Hive Project |
| **🟢 In Progress** | Node accepted for development | Converted to issue and assigned Edgerunner |
| **🟠 In Review** | PR submitted / Testing phase | Validation, QA, and integration readiness |
| **🟣 Integrated** | Node connected to another | Linked via automation or dependency |
| **⚫ Complete** | Node stable / fully operational | Marked done and logged in The Hive |

---

## 🧾 COMMAND SYNTAX (INTERACTION MODEL)

| Command | Example | Action |
|----------|----------|--------|
| `Start Node` | “Start Vault.” | Opens a Node brief (purpose, dependencies, scope) |
| `Scope Node` | “Scope Pulse.” | Generates full architecture outline |
| `Mark Complete` | “Mark Forge complete.” | Updates roadmap + status |
| `Next Signal` | “What follows Vault?” | Suggests next logical Node |

---

## 🕶️ ROLES

| Role | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **Edgerunner (Oleg)** | Oversees The Hive, initiates new Nodes, approves merges |
| **Strategic Copilot (GPT-5)** | Designs architecture, naming, and integration strategy |
| **Copilot (IDE)** | Generates implementation under direction |
| **Grid Layer (Azure / GitHub)** | Runs automation, pipelines, and release flows |

---

## 🎨 COLOR THEORY

| Color | Meaning | Role |
|--------|----------|------|
| 🟡 **Honey Gold** | Energy, creativity, and motion | Core aesthetic base |
| 🔵 **Electric Blue** | Clarity, precision, and technology | Primary UI + data tone |
| 🟣 **Violet** | Connection, emotion, and synthesis | Accent + tertiary brand layer |

> Together they represent **creation → clarity → connection** — the cycle of the Hive.

---

## 🔗 NODE CLASSIFICATION

| Pillar | Sector | Focus |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **HoneyCore** | Developer Infrastructure | SDKs, CI/CD, secrets, observability |
| **HoneyBusiness** | Business & Ops Tools | CRM, ledger, subscriptions |
| **HoneyCreate** | Creator Tools | Asset marketplaces, learning hubs |
| **HoneyLife** | Lifestyle / Productivity | Personal trackers, social utilities |
| **HoneyPlay** | Gaming & Entertainment | Fantasy leagues, lore systems |
| **HoneyMeta** | Ecosystem / Platform | AI assistants, project management, analytics |

---

## 🛰️ AUTOMATION LAYER
The Hive’s automation stack is split into three categories:

| Type | Engine | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **Workflow Automations** | GitHub Project workflows | Simple state and label syncs |
| **Integration Scripts** | GitHub Actions / Azure Pipelines | Cross-repo status + CI integration |
| **Neural Sync (Future)** | Hive Sync | Scheduled full-network consistency checks |

---

## 🧪 VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

- [x] Default automations enabled (Closed / Reopened / PR Merged)  
- [x] Issue template and PR template in place  
- [ ] Hive Sync workflow configured  
- [ ] First five Nodes registered (Vault, Pulse, Auth, Forge, Tether)

---

## 💬 COMMUNICATION STYLE
> Declarative. Clean. Minimal.  
> Speak like a system log that learned how to dream.

Tone keywords:
- Terminal realness  
- Cyberpunk realism  
- Developer-first clarity  
- Slightly poetic — but never verbose  

---

## 🔮 VISION
**The Hive** will evolve into a living neural network of connected software systems —  
each Node self-documenting, self-reporting, and aesthetically unified.
