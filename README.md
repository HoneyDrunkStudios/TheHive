# 🐝 THE HIVE  
**Founder-Controlled • AI-Advised • Copilot-Powered • Cyberpunk-Engineered**

> *“The Hive hums. Every Node connected. Every Signal alive.”*

---

### ⚙️ PURPOSE
**The Hive** is the central intelligence of **HoneyDrunk Studios** —  
a command grid uniting all Nodes (apps, SDKs, systems) under one neural network.

It serves as:
- 🧠 **The Operational Brain** — strategy, planning, and Node lifecycle tracking  
- ⚡ **The Control Grid** — automation, pipelines, and observability  
- 🎨 **The Aesthetic Core** — defining the tone and identity of all HoneyDrunk software

### 🧩 STRUCTURE

| Layer | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **The Hive** | Central coordination repo + GitHub Project |
| **Nodes** | Independent products (Vault, Pulse, Auth, Forge, Tether) |
| **Grid** | Infrastructure, DevOps, monitoring |
| **Signals** | Logs, metrics, docs, communications |

### 🪪 OPERATING PRINCIPLES

1. **Founder-Controlled:** Every Node starts from a single source of truth — the Edgerunner.  
2. **AI-Advised:** GPT-5 provides architectural strategy, naming, and process design.  
3. **Copilot-Powered:** Implementation happens inline through AI-driven assistance.  
4. **Cyberpunk-Engineered:** Every tool and page feels handcrafted and alive.  
5. **Chromatic Balance:** Honey Gold for creation, Electric Blue for precision, Violet for emotion.
